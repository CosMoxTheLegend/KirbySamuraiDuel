I randomly got the idea for this project because my friends and I used to have a lot of fun playing *Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land*—especially the samurai duel minigame. We absolutely loved it. So I thought it would be fun to create something similar. I was still learning how to code at the time, and this felt like a perfect little project to work on!


Enjoy the duel, and may your reflexes be swift ⚔️
